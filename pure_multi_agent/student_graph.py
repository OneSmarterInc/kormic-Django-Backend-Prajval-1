# pure_multi_agent/student_graph.py
# The student's personal agent, built with langgraph.prebuilt.create_react_agent
# -- the standard LangGraph pattern for "the model decides which tool(s) to
# call, in a loop, until it's ready to answer". This is what replaces the old
# fixed classify-then-branch dispatch in agents.student_agent.StudentAgent.chat().
