### Wright State vs Franklin University

| Factor | Wright State | Franklin University |
|---|---|---|
| Core identity | Traditional public university CS/CSE option | Flexible, online, career-focused MSCS pathway |
| Best fit | Students wanting campus-based university experience, applied research, AFRL/Dayton connection | Students wanting practical software skills, online flexibility, working-adult format, or non-CS pathway |
| Research orientation | Stronger fit for applied research and regional lab/defense ecosystem | Better framed as professional/career advancement rather than research-heavy CS |
| Flexibility | Traditional university structure | 100% online program family with focus areas |
| Focus areas | CS/CSE, AI, cybersecurity, systems, HCI, applied research | Cybersecurity, Data Analytics, Software Systems, general MSCS |
| Budget lens | Public university value and possible assistantships, verify details | Per-credit tuition model; verify latest cost and partner discounts |
| Prestige lens | Not top-10 but more traditional university signal | Not a prestige/research play; practical career pathway |
{github_row}

**Simple advice:** Wright State is better if the student wants a traditional university environment, applied research, and regional opportunities around Dayton/AFRL. Franklin is better if the student values flexibility, online study, practical software/system skills, or a bridge into CS from a non-traditional background.
