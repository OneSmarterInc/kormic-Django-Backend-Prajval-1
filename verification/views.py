    The "verification pending list" -- one row per flagged disagreement.
    Read-only history; does not trigger a reanalysis and cannot resolve an
    item -- both of those happen only through chat with the student's
    personal agent.

    `status` accepts either a broad bucket (`open`, `resolved`, `all`) or
    one specific outcome (`confirmed`, `ignored`, `clarified`,
    `auto_cleared`, `superseded`) so a "history" screen can filter down to
    exactly one kind of resolution. `summary` in the response always has
    counts for every outcome, regardless of which filter was requested, so
    a single call can drive both the filtered list and a tab/count row.
