# personas/university_persona_builder.py
# Assembles a university agent's system-prompt "constitution" dynamically
# from a University row's structured fields, mirroring how
# personas/aria_constitution.py's AGENT_CONSTITUTION_TEMPLATE.format(...)
# builds the student agent's persona from a name + profile instead of a
# hand-written file per student.
#
# Admin input only ever fills named template slots below -- it never
# authors or overrides the fixed safety/behavioral rules (output format,
# the default answer shape, and the "never invent numbers" guardrails).
# Replaces the two hand-written per-university constitutions that used to
# live in personas/university_personas.py.
