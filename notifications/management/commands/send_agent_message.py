    """
    Send a proactive, agent-initiated message to a student: it's written into
    their agent chat thread and push-notified, exactly like a live agent
    reply, but without the student having asked anything first.

    This is the manual/ops entry point for "the agent notifies the student
    on its own" -- any future scheduled job or in-graph agent action that
    needs to reach out proactively should call
    notifications.services.send_agent_message() directly instead of
    shelling out to this command; this command just exercises that same
    function for manual testing and one-off ops use.

    Usage:
        python manage.py send_agent_message <student_id> "<message>" [--title "..."]
