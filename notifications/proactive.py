"""
Proactive agent outreach: the student agent noticing something worth
mentioning (a resume gap, a low profile score, a missing test score) and
messaging the student about it on its own, instead of waiting to be asked.

Deliberately template-based rather than another LLM call per student per
scan: django_api.services.compute_profile_intelligence() already computes
weaknesses/recommendations/completeness from live profile data (see its own
docstring -- those are NOT stale DB columns, they're recomputed fresh every
call), and agents.resume_parser already stores real gaps on intake. This
reuses that existing, already-trustworthy analysis instead of re-deriving it.
