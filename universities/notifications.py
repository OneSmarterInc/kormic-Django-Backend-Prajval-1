# universities/notifications.py
# Two escalation emails to a knowledge group's contact:
#   send_escalation_routed_alert  -- fired automatically the moment an
#       escalation is routed to the group (from the agent's escalation path).
#       Best-effort: never raises, so a mail failure can't block escalation
#       creation.
#   send_escalation_digest_email  -- the officer-triggered "notify" button.
#       Here the caller explicitly clicked and needs to know whether the
#       email went out, so this one reports success/failure instead.
