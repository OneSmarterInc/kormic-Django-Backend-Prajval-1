class ActivityLog(models.Model):
    """
    Audit trail covering both admin-initiated actions against another
    user's account (TOTP reset, forced password reset, session
    revocation) and self-service auth activity (register, login,
    logout) -- so a superadmin can see the full account history in one
    place, not just what other superusers have done.

    Written from two apps: project_superuser (its own admin actions,
    via log_activity()) and accounts (register/login/logout, via a
    lazy import of the same helper -- accounts stays the foundational
    app other apps depend on, so it reaches into project_superuser at
    call time rather than project_superuser reaching down into it).

    actor/target are kept as nullable FKs (SET_NULL) plus a
    denormalized email/role snapshot, so entries stay readable even
    after the account in question is later deleted, and so a failed
    login against an email with no matching account can still be
    logged (target_user null, target_email/target_role blank).
